# Javascript Instantiation Patterns

JavaScript provide four different instantion patterns. They are:
* Functional
* Functional Shared
* Prototypal
* Pseudo-Classical

This repo shows how to implment all four of these instantiation patterns. Functionality for each pattern is shown in the use of a stack and a queue.

Methods to push, pull and show size of a stack are implmented in all four instantiation patterns.
Methods to enqueue, dequeue and show size of a queue are implement in all four instantiation patterns.
